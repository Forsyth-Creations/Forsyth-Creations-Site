        ### Personal Projects
        Before middle school, I was constantly designing things.
        With newfound CAD and code skills that I have picked up
        since then, numerous projects have been born. The 3D printers I built, with more mods than I can count, have been the backbone of that dedication to design.

        ### Working at Torc Robotics
        Torc is an autonomous truck company devoted to making the highways safer through robotic assistance.
        They specialize in 18 wheelers, implementing LIDAR and cameras for better control.
        For the entire 2022 school year, I have had the pleasure of learning from their engineers, take on new tasks
        as well as work on full-stack web development. This is something that was foreign to me, but
        Torc gave me the flexibility to learn in every aspect where I was lacking knowledge.
        Pushing the limits of my knowledge is something I find wonderfully exhausting
        It takes focus and dedication, all of which have been enstilled within me at Torc.

        ### Forsyth Creations

        Forsyth Creations is a passion project of mine. It started out as a way to catalog my projects.
        A way of identifying my work. However, over the years it has morphed into something new. Not only
        is Forsyth Creations for my work, but it represents my small-business of CAD, coding, and fabrication
        consultancy. It also is the monicure that my YouTube channel resides under. As I create more, I want
        to better document my work so that others can learn and build from it. After all, Newton said
        "If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants". I want to help others
        see further, in any way I can.

        ### UVA Researcher

        This was one of the greatest experiences of my early career. After being apart of an engineering 
        piolet program in 8th grade, I had the pleasure of meeting Dr.Bull at UVA. Like any professor,
        I could tell he was driven to succeed in his research. Not only that, he cared for the success of
        his students. That mix makes him an incredible force for good. Under him, I was encouraged to learn
        CAD, code, and a miriad of other skills. He connected me with his collegues, such as Dr.Littman of
        Princeton, as well as employees James Rutter and Jo Watt, to develop engineering teaching aids based
        on 19th century technology (telegraph, linear motor, speaker, etc). I worked under them for about 6 years,
        and don't regret a single moment. Check out our work at <a href="https://maketolearn.org/" >maketolearn.org</a>

        ### VT Research/Student

        In this position, I worked with the BatLab to research devices that would mimic the horseshoe bat. With their
        impressive echolocation abilities, my team was interested in reproducing a facimily for advanced sound-based
        3D imaging and perception. This led the team in many directions. My job was mainly in system integration, where
        I linked the physical hardware and PCBs to the Python and MatLab-generated deep-learning model. Check out more
        of our work here: <a href="https://vtx.vt.edu/articles/2021/04/me-research-batear.html" > BatBot Project</a>

        ### Galileo LLC

        My freshman year of college, despite it being cur short due to COVID, I applied and was accepted to an LLC on campus:
        The Galileo/Hipatia living-learning community, for engineers. It was here where I met some of my closest friends,
        and was able to meet likeminded individuals who encouraged me to work smarter.

        ### YouTube Channel

        Ever since COVID struck, and I was sent home, I have been looking for a creative outlet. Much of my time was spent working,
        or running my private consultancy for CAD (Primarily Fusion 360) and code (Primarily C++). However, when I was granted
        that rare moment of freetime, I spent it making YouTube videos. In fact, the private consultancy is usually what funds my projects.
        So, combining my hobby and my occupation, I created "Forsyth Creations".

        ### Amp Lab Mentor

        The Amp Lab is a student run, student led organization at Virgina Tech for the EE and CPE departments. It is designed to be a 
        space where students can develop their ideas, while also teaching them proper project budgeting, and valuble team-working skills.
        Through the Amp Lab's funding, I was able to create a smart mirror, which I proudly display on my YouTube channel. Check out
        all the student projects here: <a href="https://amp-lab-at-vt.github.io/web/" >Amp Lab Website</a>

        ### Signs for Non-Profits

        An engineer thrives on problem-solving. At the core of being an engineer, we are meant to help others. Making signs for non-profits
        has given me that chance to help others, all while using my talents. This side gig, which I have done both on commission and for free,
        is one of the most fufilling parts of my life. Organizations that I have helped are the following:
        - <a href="https://www.wintergreenadaptivesports.org/" >Wintergreen Adaptive Sports</a>
        - <a href="https://vtcatholic.com/" >Catholic Campus Ministry at VT</a>
