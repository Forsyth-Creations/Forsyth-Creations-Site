# Rules for the Lab

## 3D Printers 

1. All plastic around the printers must be placed in the trash before the end of the night. This includes:
* Plastic on the floor, which should be vacuumed up
* All plastic bits that may be around the printers
2. All tools should be placed in their appropriate location
* Wrenches and Allen Keys should be place in the Ender drawers
* All flush cuts, putty knifes, etc should be placed on the rack magnents
3. All extra hardware should be stored
* You may choose to store your extra parts in your room, or on the extra shelf in the corner

## General Lab Space

1. The large work tables may occupy any project at will for a span of 3 days. Any timeframe longer must be verified with lab users. Once the project is complete, the entirety of the project must be cleaned up. This includes:
* Throwing away any boxes related to the project (Take them out to the trash)
* Returning all used tools to their appropriate locations
* Making sure the table is clear and wiped up
2. Floors must remain clean **at all times** unless okay-ed by other lab users
3. Power tools can be used and shared, but must be returned to their original location to mitigate confusion over tool ownership
4. The table in the common room may be used for projects, but any mess must be cleaned up before end of day.

## Misc

1. Henry will provide identifying stickers for tools and boxes at any point needed, as this will reduce confusion over tool ownership

## Punishments

These rules mean nothing if there is no punishment. Any member who fails to comply after 3 warnings will be forced to deep-clean their counterparts kitchen. In this case, anyone from C side who cannot keep to the letter of their agreement must clean the A side kitchen, and vice versa

# TLDR

The lab space is a great space to great some spectacular things. Let's not abuse it, and make sure no one else has to clean up after someone else's mess. The lab space should also be presentable for when special guests come over, such as Torc, Pratt Miller, Dreams Lab, etc.
