# Henry Forsyth

Henry Forsyth is the sole operator of "Forsyth Creations", a site meant to showcase his designs, while also giving others the files and background necessary to build their own ideas. His experience with woodworking, Arduino, and CAD gives him a broad range of capabilities when it comes to design. Beyond his personal projects, you will find that the Forsyth mark extends into his local community. He has worked with the UVA Curry School to develop pre-made kits to help teach students fundamentals of electricity and electromagnetism. Additionally he has worked for Wintergreen Adaptive Sports, a local non-profit, producing three custom-made signs for their ski hut. He continues his education as a proud Hokie, where he continues to work as a CAD consultant for local businesses.
