# Context

So I'm working on a robot right now, and need a place to dump some links. As such, this seems to be the place! Here are some great links that I have used for calulating various mechanical systems:

[Calculating Distance between belts for pulley](https://sudenga.com/resources/figuring-belt-lengths-and-distance-between-pulleys/)

This page will be updated as I work on the project with more links!
