# Great Links for Building a Robot

So I'm working on a robot right now, and need a place to dump some links. As such, this seems to be the place! Here are some great links that I have used for calulating various mechanical systems:

[Calculating Distance between belts for pulley](https://sudenga.com/resources/figuring-belt-lengths-and-distance-between-pulleys/)

[Figuring out what connector you need](https://core-electronics.com.au/guides/Identify-Electrical-Connectors/)

[Flipsky Connection Type - JST-ZH](https://flipsky.net/collections/accessories/products/flipsky-esc-sensor-wires)

This page will be updated as I work on the project with more links!
